TODO: jot pad for libS52.so missing stuff, bug, snag, ... , brain dump

Last update:
2013JAN - add link to Pavel Kalian RleEditor, add Testing section


Curent focus (top priority *):

    GL:
**  -alarm (safety perimeter, x-track!), try the GL cursor pick trick and GL diamond rule for 9x9 pixels
*   -handle overlaping symbol at the center of the screen (find test case to debug)
    -fading chart boudary, calib symb, ..
    -implement patern scale spacing (PASP field)
    -handle GLU_TESS_MAX_COORD

    PL:
*   -view group or somme equivalent functionality
    -overscale (DATCVR01)
    -experimental: supression of overlapping simple lines (ie LS() - not LC()) (also of same disp prio AREAS/LINES)
    -fix breaker color problem in CA49995A.000
    -check/validate QUAPOS of spatial (not attribute) object
    -dump vector (same as saving display list / VBO!)
    -upgrade to WRECK03 (C_s_md2.pdf: Item No. PL03.0.d02.cl.035)
    -isobath tag

    Coding:
*   -use masked lines field (OGR/S57 MASK/FSPT) to use the line overlap trick
*   -chart manager / chart extent / CATALOG.031 (client job!)
    -check CRC32 of S57 in CATALOG.031
    -read text referenced by CATALOG.031 (some text in M_NPUB also)
    -write back mariner's parameter to .cfg (client job!)
    -use the glib "Key-value file parser" to load/save .cfg

    Testing:
    -apitrace: to record gl*() calls / playback / diff / optimisation
    
In a day:
    -libgdal.a: full build is heavy, build only with the final driver set (S57, PNG, shapefile)
    -code: static global variable should all be inside a context struct .. of course!
    -BUG: S-52 specs 3.2 for TOPMAR01 (init 'floating' inside loop)
    -OGR: IHOOCDD.XXX
    -GL: display 'dipping distance' of light (need the height of eye and sea level)
    -GL: bearing snap to light
    -GL: optimisation - LOD --> reduce the nbr of vertex in area/line (NP, need heuristique)
    -PL: implement vector instruction command: symbol call (SC), arc (AA)
    -PL: implement raster instruction for pattern and symbol (PBTM, SBTM)
    -PL: SCAMAX
    


DONE
====
(put here TODO's that has been done)

    -text shadow
    -WARN: chart no 1 PLib put $LINE in layer 0
    -check handling anti-meridian (need a chart that overlap the meridian to debug)
    -check user (if root warn & exit)
    -load raster (RADAR Layer, high density bathy,...)
    -signal object that land in layer 0 (ex TOPMAR/CA49995A.000/geo.id:123)
    -handle C_AGGR and C_ASSO to showup in crusor pick (2 - slave, 3 - peer, need to hack GDAL TEMP_BUFFER_SIZE)
    -display text description of symbol in PLib in cursor pick
    -HTML5/SVG: s52ui (Dart & PhoneGap) handle web stuff (WebSocket)
    -code: many S52_drawStr() params could be drawn from inside S52_drawLast()
	-PL: editor (see Pavel Kalian https://github.com/nohal/RleEditor)
    -load Chart No 1 for testing C1-PLib 3.1 (the default PLib)
    -handling GDAL (world) shapefile to fit S52 framework
    -test for proper configure of openev when loading libS52.so
    -text grouping
    -click on north arrow to get north up (the code is in s52egl.c - tested on Android)
	-ARM / android / EGL / GLESv2
    -(!!)PL: GFileMonitor for new (drop in) PLib
    -put 'cursor' symbol on layer 9 (S52 say 8, but ownshp is on layer 9)
     and then use drawLast()
    -GL: S52_viewport(): overview/magnifying glass a la ghostview (debug)
    -ajust height for datum, diff in VDAT/SDAT of DSPM (Data Set Parameter --DISD layer in OGR)
    -graticule spacing set by user via S52_MAR_DISP_GRATICULE
    -dbus (partial)
    -handle signal async (interrupt drawing, segfault, ...)
    -GPSD/AIS
    -GL: curves (in LEGLIN)
    -(partial - only LC()) supression of overlapping lines (HARD -need to tweak GDAL)
    -thread awaire
    -handle multiple cells
    -Mariner's object
    -chart rotation (ship head up)
    -handle change in display prority
    -optimisation of pattern drawing
    -plug ftgl to anti-alias font
    -cursor pick
    -centered point symbol on line object
    -supress display of offseted centered symbol that fall outside of poly
    -glPushAttrib() to save GL state of the caller
    -compute scale to display sector radius in Nautical Miles
    -add symbol scale factor in config (what was that !)
    -handle update: reparse CS (ex: new value for TX cmd)
    -SCAMIN scale filter (CS: SCANMIN set to INFINITY)
    -dotpitch
    -move centroid inside concave poly for centered symbol
    -make _depareL local to a cell
    -handle reparse of CS instead realoading cells to force CS parse
    -move X stuff in separate file
    -GTK2
    -mingw (portabilty)
    -draw text at 'display priority' 8
    -use GEOS instead of stencil for CS --GEOS too slow
    -jitter/mismatch "Line Style" or "Line Color" with "Area Color"
      * was due to overscale .. at nanometer zoom double implode
