  Acronym:    six character code for the Attribute.

  Code: integer code to be used in the coding of data.

   Attribute type: one character code for the Attribute type (see below)

  Each Attribute is assigned to one of six types:

  * enumerated (E'): The expected input is a number selected from a list of pre- defined attribute values. Exactly one value must be chosen. The abbreviation for this type is E'.

  * list (L'): The expected input is a list of one or more numbers selected from a list of pre-defined attribute values. Where more than one value is used, they must normally be separated by commas but in special cases slashes ("/") may be used. The abbreviation for this type is L'.

    Note: In some cases, dependency exists between different attributes of a given object e.g. a bridge (BRIDGE) may have the values concreted' and iron/steel' for the attribute NATCON (Nature of Construction) and the values red' and green' for the attribute COLOUR. Even if it is known that the concreted part of the bridge is red and the iron/steel part is green, the Object Catalogue provides no means of indicating this relationship. However, such relationships may be formalized for a given application in which case the relationship must be described in the appropriate Product Specification (see S-57 Appendix B).

  * float (F'): The expected input is a floating point numeric value with defined range, resolution, units and format. The abbreviation for this type is F'.

  * integer (I'): The expected input is an integer numeric value with defined range, units and format. The abbreviation for this type is I'.

  * coded string (A'): The expected input is a string of ASCII
characters in a predefined format. The information is encoded according
to defined coding systems e.g.: the nationality will be encoded by a
two character field specified by ISO 3166 Codes for the Representation
of Names of Countries', e.g. Canada => CA' (refer to S-57 Appendix A
Annex A). The abbreviation for this type is A'.

  * free text (S'): The expected input is a free-format alphanumeric
string. It may be a file name which points to a text or graphic file.
The abbreviation for this type is S'.

  Expected input:

  Depending on the attribute type, the expected input is defined in the following ways:

  For  E' and L' type attributes a list of ID-numbers with associated, defined, meanings is given. Where an attribute value which appeared in a previous edition of the Standard is no longer used, it is retained in the list but is struck-through.

  For A', F', I' and S'-type attributes the expected input is indicated  in accordance with the type (see above).

  In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to indicate to the recipient of a data set that the value of a certain attribute for an instance of an object class is unknown. This fact is encoded by a zero length attribute value sub-field, e.g. COLOUR (where  is the subfield delimiter). This applies to all attribute types (see S-57 Part 3 clause 2.1).

  Definitions: a definition of the Attribute, or in the case of E' or L' type Attributes, a definition of each value of an Attribute.

  References:

  * INT 1: Reference to the system of numbering for the paper chart feature as used in the International Chart Series INT 1 - Symbols, Abbreviations, Terms used on Charts'. INT 1 was one of the major guidelines for the definition of attributes.

  * M-4: Reference to the paragraph number in the Chart Specifications of the IHO', M-4. This was another guideline for the definition and description of the attributes.

  Minimum Value: The minimum value for the expected input is indicated for floating point and integer attributes.

  Maximum Value: The maximum value for the expected input is indicated for floating point and integer  attributes.

  Remarks: Under Remarks', further comments and notes may be given.

Depending on the type of attribute, the  following information is provided:

  Indication: For coded string type attributes (S) it indicates the construction of the string.

   For integer (I) and floating point (F) type attributes it indicates the units and resolution of the input.

  Format: The Format' statement indicates the recommended standard input template. Attributes that are identified as requiring a mandatory format, are indicated by the term (mandatory). For other attributes, the format can be either implied by the domain of valid attribute values or will be variable in length depending on the attribute and its data type.

  Example: an example of coded input.

There are five National Language Attributes which are defined in Section 2.3. These are all string type attributes intended to hold text in a national language.

There are three Attributes that are defined as attributes of spatial
objects. For further information see Section 2.4.

Remarks:

To decide on a ZOC Category, all conditions outlined in columns 2 to 4 of the table must be met.

Footnote numbers quoted in the table have the following meanings:

1 The allocation of a ZOC indicates that particular data meets minimum criteria for position and depth accuracy and seafloor coverage defined in this Table. Data may be further qualified by Object Class "Quality of Data" (M_QUAL) sub-attributes as follows:

 a) Positional Accuracy (POSACC) and Sounding Accuracy (SOUACC) may be used to indicate that a higher position or depth accuracy has been achieved than defined in this Table (e.g. a survey where full seafloor coverage was not achieved could not be classified higher that ZOC B; however, if the position accuracy was, for instance,  15 metres, the sub-attribute POSACC could be used to indicate this).

 b) Swept areas where the clearance depth is accurately known but the actual seabed depth is not accurately known may be accorded a "higher" ZOC (i.e. A1 or A2) providing positional and depth accuracies of the swept depth meets the criteria in this Table. In this instance, Depth Range Value 1 (DRVAL1) may be used to specify the swept depth. The position accuracy criteria apply to the boundaries of swept areas.

 c) SURSTA, SUREND and TECSOU may be used to indicate the start and end dates of the survey and the technique of sounding measurement.

2 Position Accuracy of depicted soundings at 95% CI (2.45 sigma) with respect to the given datum. It is the cumulative error and includes survey, transformation and digitizing errors etc. Position accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.

3 Depth accuracy of depicted soundings = a + (bd)/100 at 95% CI (2.00 sigma), where d = depth in metres at the critical depth. Depth accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated  based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.

4 Significant seafloor features are defined as those rising above depicted depths by more than:

  Depth  Significant Feature

 a. <10 metres  >0.1depth,
 b. 10 to 30 metres  >1.0 metre,
 c. >30 metres  >(0.1depth) minus 2.0 metres

5 Controlled, systematic (high accuracy) survey (ZOC A1, A2 and B) - a survey comprising planned survey lines, on a geodetic datum that can be transformed to WGS 84.

 Position fixing (ZOC A1) must be strong with at least three high quality Lines of Position (LOP) or Differential GPS.

 Modern survey echosounder - a high precision surveying depth measuring equipment, generally including all survey echosounders designed post 1970.

Some attributes qualify the location of an object, as opposed to defining the characteristics of the individual object itself.

Attributes specifying the accuracy and quality of a position (x,y - coordinates) and the reference datum for horizontal measurement are considered to be attributes of spatial objects.

Within a data set encoded according to S-57, the attributes of spatial objects are held in the Spatial Record Attribute field (refer to S-57 Part 3).

Definitions:

surveyed: the position(s) was(were) determined by the operation of making measurements for determining the relative position of points on, above or beneath the earth's surface.  Survey implies a regular, controlled survey of any date. (adapted from IHO Dictionary, S-32, 5195, & IHO Chart Specifications, M-4, 175.2)

unsurveyed: survey data is does not exist or is very poor.  (adapted from IHO Dictionary, S- 32, 5732)

inadequately surveyed: position data is of a very poor quality. (adapted from IHO Dictionary, S-32, 5732)

approximate: a position that is considered to be less than third-order accuracy, but is generally considered to be within 30.5 metres of its correct geographic location.  Also may apply to an object whose position does not remain fixed.  (adapted from IHO Dictionary, S-32, 213, 3967, & IHO Specifications, M-4, 424.1)

position doubtful: an object whose position has been reported but which is considered to be doubtful.

unreliable: an object's position obtained from questionable or unreliable data.

reported (not surveyed):
  an object whose position has been reported and its position confirmed by some means other than a formal survey such as an independent report of the same object.

reported (not confirmed):
  an object whose position has been reported and its position has not been confirmed.

estimated: the most probable position of an object determined from incomplete data or data of questionable accuracy. (adapted from IHO Dictionary, S-32, 3960)

precisely known: a position that is of a known value, such as the position of an anchor berth or other defined object.

calculated: a position that is computed from data.
